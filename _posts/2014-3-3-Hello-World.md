Welcome to my personal website! This place catalogues all of my neuroscience, data analysis and machine learning projects. My objective is to use my computer science skills to aid the bioengineering revolution of this century, leveraging deep learning tools to solve large quantative biological tasks. 

<!---
my motivation for this essentially came from a mix of a search of purpose, a kurzegatz video I watched in my senior year of highschool and other books and online resources claiming that problems such as alzeihmer's, cancer and even mortality might be solved.
