## About Me
I'm a 2nd year master's student at EPFL studying Neuro-X, I'm currently looking for an internship to finish my studies. 
> This place catalogues all of my neuroscience, data analysis and machine learning projects. My objective is to use my computer science skills to aid the bioengineering revolution, leveraging deep learning tools to solve large quantative biological tasks. 

<!---
my motivation for this essentially came from a mix of a search of purpose, a kurzegatz video I watched in my senior year of highschool and other books and online resources claiming that problems such as alzeihmer's, cancer and even mortality might be solved.
