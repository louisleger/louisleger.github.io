Will collect lessons learned and statements of gratitude, maybe some jokes. <br>
My favorite joke of 2024 is: <br>
<div style="text-align: center;"> "All I know is that if I was a billionaire, I would also tell people the secret was cold showers and waking up at 5am"</div>

    Start with the titans of my parents, then more recently Philip Egger, Abel Archundia, Felix Naef, potentially André Jaun (entropy and urgency)
    Miguel Nakarino, Jesus Polo, Rosa Polo, Vanessa Archundia, Dani and Yaiza, Alain and Abel, Felix, Ixil, Leo, Leo Catteau, Loïc et Marion, Carla, Theo, Florian.
    Marie Christine Bonnart, Yann et Gaelle, Dominique et Monica et David. 
    
    If you are not mentionned you may take the appropriate offense.
