Collection of lessons learned and statements of gratitude, maybe some jokes. 
<br><br> My favorite joke of 2024 is: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;"> "All I know is that if I was a billionaire, I would also tell people the secret was cold showers and waking up at 5am"</div>

<br>
2025:
<div style="margin-left: 2em;""> Changing random stuff until your program works is "hacky" and "bad practice".
                         But if you do it fast enough its "Machine Learning" and pays 4x your current salary.</div>
