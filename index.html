            Hello! I'm a master's student in computational neuroscience at EPFL.
            I'm currently a visiting student at MIT in the Edelman Lab fitting transcriptomics.
            My main research interest is deep learning applied to biology but recently, I am interested in a more formal understanding of data and its organisation which can be anything from information geometry to random matrix theory.

            This website was originally intended to archive my projects but will progressively include personal items such as quotes and jokes.

    Following a rich learning experience at the Naef Lab, I developped a regression model that integrates sequential cellular brightfield images and predicts the cell cycle phase from the FUCCI system. This led to a paid summer internship, where we explored the limits of this model. As I resume my education, I will stay in close contact with the lab and this project, with the goal of a publication.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16;">
    This fall, I will be starting an exciting 6-month internship at Metadvice. A start-up where I will be tasked to implement new clinical decision support models. The main focus will be comorbid situations and investigating model explainability with Shapley values. I am glad to be returning to tabular machine learning and hope to contribute some ideas like KAN-interpretability.
    I will also be starting a shorter semester project with Ilaria Ricchi, benchmarking novel implementations of graph mixture models, where I hope to learn more graph theory and connectome analysis.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16;">
    I am glad to be applying my skills in a fitting field and hope to continue in search of a master's thesis for the spring of 2025.

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16;">
    In the spring of 2024, I will be joining the Naef Lab of computational biology as a master's student to investigate latent space models for cell cycle trajectories with live imaging data. My goal will be to implement self-supervised learning techniques and explore the utility of "nested" vision transformers to make use of the 3rd dimension.

## About Me
I'm a 2nd year master's student at EPFL studying Neuro-X, I'm currently looking for an internship to finish my studies. 
This place catalogues all of my neuroscience, data analysis and machine learning projects. My objective is to use my computer science skills to aid the bioengineering revolution, leveraging deep learning tools to solve large quantative biological tasks. 

my motivation for this essentially came from a mix of a search of purpose, a kurzegatz video I watched in my senior year of highschool and other books and online resources claiming that problems such as alzeihmer's, cancer and even mortality might be solved.
